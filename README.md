# IOT-Based-Home-Automation
A home automation system is a technological solution that enables the automation of various electronic tasks within a home. The proposed system consists of two main components: hardware and software. I used a smartphone, Arduino, and Bluetooth module in the hardware aspect. On the software side, the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a Bluetooth terminal smartphone application were employed for wireless communication between the smartphone and the Arduino board.
